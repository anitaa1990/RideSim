     * This method processes the results of a permission request and categorizes them into:
     * - Granted permissions: All permissions that were successfully granted by the user.
     * - Denied permissions: Permissions that were denied by the user.
     * - Rationale-needed permissions: Permissions that were denied and require an explanation
     *   (via `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale`).
     *
     * Based on the categorization, this method invokes the appropriate callback for granted or denied permissions.
     *
     * @param permissions The permissions that were requested.
     * @param result A map where the key is the permission string, and the value is a boolean indicating
     *               whether the permission was granted (`true`) or denied (`false`).
     * @param onGranted A callback invoked when all requested permissions are granted.
     *                  Use this to proceed with the operation that requires permissions.
     * @param onDenied A callback invoked when one or more permissions are denied.
     *                 - The first parameter is the list of denied permissions.
     *                 - The second parameter is the list of permissions that require a rationale.
